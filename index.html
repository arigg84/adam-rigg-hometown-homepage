        <p>Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas. The city is located in southeast Scotland and is bounded to the north by the 
        Firth of Forth estuary and to the south by the Pentland Hills. Edinburgh had a population of 506,520 in mid-2020, making it the second-most populous city 
        in Scotland and the seventh-most populous in the United Kingdom. The wider metropolitan area had a population of 912,490 in the same year. <br><br>
        
        Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in 
        Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. It is also the annual venue of the General Assembly 
        of the Church of Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the 
        sciences and engineering. <br><br>
        
        The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research 
        institutions in the world. It is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest 
        internationally. The city is a cultural centre, and is the home of institutions including the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of 
        Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. <br><br>
        
        The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world's 
        largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of St. Giles, 
        Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. <br><br>
        
        Edinburgh's Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999. The city's historical and cultural attractions have made 
        it the UK's second-most visited tourist destination, attracting 4.9 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018.  Edinburgh is governed 
        by the City of Edinburgh Council, a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of 514,990 in mid-2021, and 
        includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in the Lothian region and was historically part of the shire of 
        Midlothian.</p>
